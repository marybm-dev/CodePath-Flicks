This is an iOS application leveraging the Fl API to display images for specified blog (Humans of New York in this particular app).

###Time spent: 13 hours

###Completed required user stories:
* [x] Now Playing movies in ListView with overview and poster image.
* [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
* [x] User sees loading state while waiting for movies API.
* [x] User sees an error message when there's a networking error. 
* [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

###Completed optional user stories:
* [x] Add a tab bar for Now Playing or Top Rated movies.
* [x] Implement a UISegmentedControl to switch between a list view and a grid view.
* [ ]	Add a search bar.
* [x]	All images fade in as they are loading.
* [x]	For the large poster, load the low-res image first and switch to high-res when complete.
* [x]	Customize the highlight and selection effect of the cell.
* [x]	Customize the navigation bar.

###Notes:
In addition I have added the following:
* Launch Screen
* Infinite scrolling to fetch next page(s) : this demonstrates use of the API's *page* parameter.
* Custom tab bar
* Added extension for UIColor to use hex
